# Write_Like_Sun_Tzu_LSTM 
# [Machine Learning]
I created a recurrent neural network (LSTM) that writes text in the style of Sun Tzu.<br>
The network takes in a text file of Sun Tzu's book, The Art of War, and generates a text file in the same writing style.<br>

I ran the script 8 times and I combined the texts together afterwards. You can view the indivually generated texts <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/JeremyLau01/Write_Like_Sun_Tzu_LSTM/tree/master/Generated%20Texts">here</a><br>
Note: the generated text may not make sense, but it contains common ideas and words used throughout the book.<br>
